# Panel

## Panelists

* Hartmut Kaiser, Center for Computation & Technology at Louisiana State University, USA
* Laxmikant (Sanjay) Kale, Department of Computer Science,University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign, USA
* Martin Berzins, Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, USA
* Mike Bauer, NVIDIA, USA



## Panel's chosen questions

* Are AMT programs more difficult to debug because it is (1) more easy to create race conditions and (2) more difficult to get anything like a stack trace? What is being done to make debugging of large scale AMT applications easier.
* What sort of language support is needed for AMT programming?
    - What advantage do newer languages like Go, Julia, etc. have for AMT programming and can/should they displace C++ for scientific applications?
    - Many languages have added "await" or some variant as new keywords for processing of asynchronous code. How important is this feature for the success of the AMT paradigm?
