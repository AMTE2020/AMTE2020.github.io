Panel Questions
* Are AMT programs more difficult to debug because it is (1) more easy to create race conditions and (2) more difficult to get anything like a stack trace? What is being done to make debugging of large scale AMT applications easier.
* What sort of language support is needed for AMT programming?
    - What advantage do newer languages like Go, Julia, etc. have for AMT programming and can/should they displace C++ for scientific applications?
    - Many languages have added "await" or some variant as new keywords for processing of asynchronous code. How important is this feature for the success of the AMT paradigm?
